Team Project: Design a discord bot 
    This Discord bot will be an RPG simulator accessed through discord
    Bot will be similarly modeled to Epic RPG Maker
    It will have distinct differences and unique features, potentially including:
        More specified Combat: Strategic options and flee option instead of having a random outcome
        A better interface: combining inventory with profile stats instead of having them both separate
        Add a party aspect: allowing players to communicate with one another
        Adding different weapon options
